title: One of my work selves
bio: |
  I am a London and China based filmmaker whose work drifts between documentary, performance, ethnography, and research.
  I am interested in rural change, queer and female experiences, nature, mythology, cross-cultrual comparison and much more. I dislike viewing beings as projects. I approach images with curiosity, persistence and a deep respect for the stories that shape lives.
  Feel free to contact me if you think there is any possibility for collaboration now or in the future.

  This is me, hiking and climbing with extra lenses, because my shutter
  refuses to miss a moment.
