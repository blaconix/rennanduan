title: About Me
bio: |
  I am a London and China based filmmaker whose work drifts between documentary, performance, ethnography, and research. 
  I am interested in rural change, queer and female experiences, nature, cross-cultrual comparison and much more. I dislike viewing beings as projects. I approach images with curiosity, persistence and a deep respect for the stories that shape lives.
  Feel free to contact me if you think there is any possibility for collaboration now or in the future.
