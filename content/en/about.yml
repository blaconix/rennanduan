title: One of my work selves
bio: I am a London and China based filmmaker whose work drifts between documentary, performance, ethnography and research. I am interested in rural change, queer and female experiences, nature, cross-cultrual comparison and much more. I dislike viewing beings as projects. I approach images with curiosity, persistence and a deep respect for the stories that shape lives. Feel free to contact me if you think there is any possibility for collaboration now or in the future.

subtitle: This is me, attempting to seek inspiration for docs, but always finding myself communicating with cliffs instead (and eventually developing good ideas).
